This project is to demonstrate my learning of Rails, Ruby,
Backbone, Node, JavaScript, JQuery, etc. etc. 
It will be quite similar to the website "Trello", except it 
may be more troll-oriented.

Features will include: 
- User login page
- User authentication
- Todo Cards
- Dynamic Card interface
- Automated scheduling algorithms
